The project allows for tracking and querying of specific datasets involving students, instructors, and classes.

## Description

This project showcases my ability to clean and organize given data into tables in third normal form. It demonstrates my ability to use queries to return complex intersections of data. It also includes a form so that non-technical users can enter new data. Finally, aong with my querying skills, I created a report that shows currently enrolled students.
